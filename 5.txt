Web crawling and scrapping to extract text and image from a website


Components requires - 

Crawler :
A web crawler acts as a spider which browses the internet to index and search for content by following links.
We must first “crawl” the web to retrieve required URLs which then you pass on to your scraper.

Scrapper : 
scraper has data locators which are used to find the data that you want to extract from the HTML file

Approach :
We use an HTTP requests library (such as the Python-Requests library) 
- and combine it with the Python BeautifulSoup library to scrape data from your page.

Procedure :
1) Determine the target website
2) Collect URLs of the pages where you want to extract data from
3) Make a request to these URLs to get the HTML of the page
4) Use locators to find the images and text in the HTML
5) Save the data in file.
